# KiCad PCB Design Analysis Guide

This guide explains how to use the PCB design analysis features in the KiCad MCP Server.

## Overview

The PCB design analysis functionality allows you to:

1. Extract and analyze information from schematics
2. Validate projects for completeness and correctness
3. Get insights about components and connections
4. Understand PCB layout characteristics

## Quick Reference

| Task | Example Prompt |
|------|---------------|
| Get schematic info | `What components are in my schematic at /path/to/project.kicad_sch?` |
| Validate project | `Validate my KiCad project at /path/to/project.kicad_pro` |
| Analyze PCB | `Analyze the PCB layout at /path/to/project.kicad_pcb` |

## Using PCB Analysis Features

### Schematic Information

To extract information from a schematic:

```
What components are in my schematic at /path/to/project.kicad_sch?
```

This will provide:
- A list of all components in the schematic
- Component values and footprints
- Connection information
- Basic schematic structure

Example output:
```
# Schematic: my_project.kicad_sch

## Components (Estimated Count: 42)

(symbol (lib_id "Device:R") (at 127 87.63 0) (unit 1)
(symbol (lib_id "Device:C") (at 142.24 90.17 0) (unit 1)
(symbol (lib_id "MCU_Microchip_ATmega:ATmega328P-PU") (at 170.18 88.9 0) (unit 1)

... and 39 more components
```

### Project Validation

To check a project for issues:

```
Validate my KiCad project at /path/to/project.kicad_pro
```

The validation checks for:
- Missing project files
- Required components (schematic, PCB)
- Valid file formats
- Common structural issues

This is useful for identifying problems before opening files in KiCad.

### PCB Layout Analysis

To analyze a PCB layout:

```
Analyze the PCB layout at /path/to/project.kicad_pcb
```

This will provide information about:
- Board dimensions
- Layer structure
- Component placement
- Trace characteristics
- Via usage

## Available Resources

The server provides several resources for accessing design information:

- `kicad://schematic/{schematic_path}` - Information from a schematic file
- `kicad://pcb/{pcb_path}` - Information from a PCB file

These resources can be accessed programmatically by other MCP clients or directly referenced in conversations.

## Tips for Better Analysis

### Focus on Specific Elements

You can ask for analysis of specific aspects of your design:

```
What are all the resistor values in my schematic at /path/to/project.kicad_sch?
```

```
Show me all the power connections in my schematic at /path/to/project.kicad_sch
```

### Integration with Other Features

Combine analysis with other features for better insights:

1. Analyze a schematic first to understand component selection
2. Check the BOM for component availability and cost
3. Run DRC checks to find design rule violations
4. View the PCB thumbnail for a visual overview

## Common Analysis Tasks

### Finding Specific Components

To locate components in your schematic:

```
Find all decoupling capacitors in my schematic at /path/to/project.kicad_sch
```

This helps with understanding component usage and ensuring proper design practices.

### Identifying Signal Paths

To trace signals through your design:

```
Trace the clock signal path in my schematic at /path/to/project.kicad_sch
```

This helps with understanding signal flow and potential issues.

### Board Metrics

To get metrics about your PCB:

```
What are the dimensions of my PCB at /path/to/project.kicad_pcb?
```

```
How many vias are in my PCB at /path/to/project.kicad_pcb?
```

## Troubleshooting

### Schematic Reading Errors

If the server can't read your schematic:

1. Verify the file exists and has the correct extension (.kicad_sch)
2. Check if the file is a valid KiCad schematic
3. Ensure you have read permissions for the file
4. Try the analysis on a simpler schematic to isolate the issue

### PCB Analysis Issues

If PCB analysis fails:

1. Check if the PCB file exists and has the correct extension (.kicad_pcb)
2. Ensure the PCB file is not corrupted
3. Check for complex features that might cause parsing issues
4. Try a simplified PCB to isolate the problem

## Advanced Usage

### Design Reviews

Use the analysis features for comprehensive design reviews:

```
Review the power distribution network in my schematic at /path/to/project.kicad_sch
```

```
Check my PCB at /path/to/project.kicad_pcb for potential EMI issues
```

### Custom Analysis Scripts

For advanced users:

1. Use the schematic and PCB analysis tools to extract data
2. Ask for specific analytical insights on that data
3. Request recommendations based on the analysis
